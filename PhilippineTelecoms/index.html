        <span id="subtitle">Privacy Policy</span>
        <p>
            Philippine Telecoms is a completely offline application -- no data ever leaves your phone.
            There are no automated analytics, crash reports, etcetera.

            <br><br>

            However, when you click on the sources of various prefixes, you will be taken to the official website or social media page of the telecom provider.
            In that event, I don't have control over their data collection policies anymore. You could visit their respective privacy policies, or ask them directly.
